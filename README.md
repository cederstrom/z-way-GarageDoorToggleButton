# z-way-GarageDoorToggleButton
Home automation module for z-wave.me. This modules groups a binary sensor and a binary switch into a single device.

## Installation
The module is not in the app store yet so if you want to try it out you got to your z-way-server installation directory and clone this repo to a folder there. The restart z-way-server and you should be all set!

Eg.:

```
$ cd /opt/z-way-server/automation/userModules/
$ git clone https://github.com/cederstrom/z-way-GarageDoorToggleButton.git
$ sudo service z-way-server restart
```

## Contributions
As it is right now the modules usecase is pretty narrow. It only meets my specific needs. If you want to extend it you are welcome to file an issue or a pull request.
